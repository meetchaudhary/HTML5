 ANs: SVG: An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means
      SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG 
      over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

      CANVAS: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container
              for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles,
              text, and adding images.
